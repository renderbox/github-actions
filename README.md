jobs:
  lint-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: renderbox/github-actions/lint-and-test@v1

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: lint-and-test
    steps:
      - uses: renderbox/github-actions/build-react@v1
        with:
          artifact-name: react-build-${{ github.sha }}

  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: react-build-${{ github.sha }}
          path: dist/
      - uses: renderbox/github-actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: v${{ github.run_number }}
          release_name: "Release v${{ github.run_number }}"

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: release
    steps:
      - uses: renderbox/github-actions/deploy-s3@v1

          subfolder: my/subfolder
```

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also include **examples for Vite vs CRA builds** in the docs (since their build outputs differ), or just keep it generic with a note about adjusting the output folder?
